# Reverse_TCP_Program
Reverse TCP program written in python.

This program is a work in progress, I will continue to update the code as much as I can. I will create executable files for each python file to make it easier to use.

## Setup

**Client.py**

Host: IP address of the Server. This could be an internal address, such as 192.168.xxx.xxx, or external address
Port: Choose whatever port you wish to open a tcp connection on. Make sure "Client.py" port is the same as your "Server.py" port.

***Server.py***

SERVER_HOST: IP address of the machine you are running this program on. It must be your internal address
SERVER_PORT: Choose whatever port you wish to open a tcp connection on. Make sure "Client.py" port is the same as your "Server.py" port.

## List All Running Processes
